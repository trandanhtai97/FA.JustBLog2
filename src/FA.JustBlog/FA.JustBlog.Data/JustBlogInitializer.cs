The gangsters should each withdraw a hundred thousand yen at a time (about nine hundred dollars) but make no more than nineteen transactions per machine.

Withdrawals could start at 5 a.m. and continue until 8 a.m. The volunteers were told to choose the Japanese language when prompted—an indication, Shimomura realized, that the cards were foreign.

The first time I was in an open bog, I thought I was teleported in another planet. The working tasks in Dennis' place were interesting and pretty relaxing as well. We harvested the wild garlics, went picking wild berries and mushrooms in the forest, made the traditional Finnish bread, took care of the green house garden and the house.

Yet, insurmountable physical challenges exist, and with them comes the uncertainty of long-term human settlement on other planets. What lies waiting for us ahead in the vastness of space? What are the requirements and how do we settle down on those planets?
